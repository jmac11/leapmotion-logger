# leapmotion-logger

A simple LeapMotion logger utility created to demo the Go language library I created, whoisjake/gomotion

[Gomotion](whoisjake/gomotion) is a framework that uses the [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol to communicate with a [LeapMotion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) device.
